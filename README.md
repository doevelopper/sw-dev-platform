## Contributions

Any contributions you make to this effort **are of course greatly appreciated**.

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book series, as I (and O'Reilly) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but we just have to make the lawyers happy by explicitly stating it. So: blah, blah, blah... :)
